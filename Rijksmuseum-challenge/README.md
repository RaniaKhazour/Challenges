# Introduction
> This website shows the Rijksmuseum's collection, thanks to [Rijksmuseum API](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/).

---

## Approach to solution 

1) Create a mockup for the website.
2) Create an account [here ](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio), in order to get the key to use the API.
4) Create a new project and install react.js
3) Get the result desired from the API visible on the browser, with no style on the website yet.
4) Use Redux to remember the results from the API and show in the details page the next and the previous result.
5) Add style designed previously.
6) Check responsiveness.
7) Test the website in various screens.
8) Resolve bugs.
